# AoC 2021

## Why?

This repo is the history of my journey through [Advent of CODE 2021](https://adventofcode.com/). Learning [Go](https://github.com/golang); [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes); [AWS](https://github.com/aws); [Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform) and few other things.
